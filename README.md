# Problem Statement:
# Objective:
Imagining As a data scientist at Car Dheko, I have developed an accurate and user-friendly Streamlit-based web application for predicting the prices of used cars. This interactive tool leverages advanced machine learning algorithms and comprehensive feature engineering to provide precise car price predictions based on various input features such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more.
The application has been deployed successfully, enabling customers and sales representatives to seamlessly evaluate resale prices and make informed decisions. It enhances the customer experience by offering a transparent pricing process and supports sales efficiency by automating price estimation. The tool has streamlined operations and contributed significantly to improving customer satisfaction and business outcomes at Car Dheko.


# Project Scope:
We have historical data on used car prices from CarDekho, including various features such as make, model, year, fuel type, transmission type, and other relevant attributes from different cities. Your task as a data scientist is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of used cars based on these features. The model should be integrated into a Streamlit-based web application to allow users to input car details and receive an estimated price instantly.
